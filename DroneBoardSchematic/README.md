Drone board
Microcontroller:
- Pi Pico / STM32

Radio:
- NRF20 with external antenna

Motors:
- 4x Brushless DC motors 1000-2000KV
- 4x 15A Electric Speed Controllers

Camera and SD card:
- Undecided 

Sensors:
- Accelerometer
- Gyro
- More if needed

Battery:
- 3s Lipo battery (11.1V)
- Voltage divider or https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/274793/measure-voltage-with-no-current

Notes:
- Should be minimal in size
- Large current expected from 3s lipo so traces should account for that
- Keep sensors away from motors to ensure signal integrity
